# ðŸš€ Federated GraphQL Blockchain Project ðŸš€

Serverless architecture across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, this Terraform project showcases an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) capability, strategic multi-cloud management, and serverless technology utilization to achieve a highly scalable, reliable, and cost-efficient global application.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Summary

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective Achieved
Designed and deployed a globally distributed, serverless application providing a public-facing API for image processing. This project spanned multiple cloud platformsâ€”AWS, Azure, and Google Cloudâ€”leveraging the strengths of each to ensure optimal performance, resilience, and geographical reach.

### âœ¨ Key Features Implemented

1. **Serverless Architecture**: Integrated AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions for regional application logic execution.
2. **Global Database**: Established data consistency across AWS DynamoDB Global Tables, Azure Cosmos DB, and Google Cloud Firestore.
3. **API Gateway**: Configured Amazon API Gateway, Azure API Management, and Google Cloud Endpoints for worldwide user request handling.
4. **Cross-Cloud Networking**: Secured cross-cloud communication via VPNs and direct connects.
5. **Centralized Logging and Monitoring**: Aggregated logs and metrics into Datadog, providing a unified view of the system's health.
6. **IAM**: Implemented a unified IAM strategy using federated identity providers across clouds.
7. **Global Load Balancing**: Utilized Cloudflare for DNS management, achieving efficient global traffic routing.
8. **Security**: Enforced best security practices including network security, data encryption, and OWASP Top 10 application security measures.
9. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Established a multi-cloud CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, enhancing deployment efficiency and reliability.

### ðŸš§ Deployment Steps Completed

1. **Architected the System**: Detailed architecture diagrams were created, outlining the integration and flow across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
2. **Cloud and Terraform Setup**: Configured necessary accounts and Terraform providers, setting a solid foundation for deployment.
3. **Application Development**: Developed the serverless application with a focus on image processing, employing Docker for local testing iterations.
4. **Terraform Configuration**: Crafted Terraform modules for each infrastructure component, showcasing sophisticated multi-provider management.
5. **System Deployment**: Executed Terraform to deploy resources across the clouds, followed by comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure functionality and performance.
6. **Monitoring and Security**: Implemented centralized logging and monitoring, along with robust security controls, ensuring the system's integrity and reliability.
7. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Configured a seamless CI/CD workflow, facilitating automated, multi-cloud deployments.
